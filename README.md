# 🎤 Voice-to-Text Medical Record Generator for Doctors

## 📌 Overview
The Voice-to-Text Medical Record Generator is an AI-powered healthcare application that converts a doctor's spoken narration into a structured medical record. This system helps doctors save time on manual note-taking and improves the efficiency of patient diagnosis and documentation.

By uploading or recording voice, the system transcribes audio using a Speech-to-Text model (Whisper) and formats the content into clinical fields such as symptoms, diagnosis, prescription, advice, and follow-up.
